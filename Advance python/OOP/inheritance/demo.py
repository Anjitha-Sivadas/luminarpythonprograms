# Inheritance is defined as the capability of one class to derive or
# inherit the properties from some other class and use it whenever needed.

# 1 It represents real-world relationships well.
# 2 It provides reusability of code. We don’t have to write
#   the same code again and again.Also, it allows us to add
#   more features to a class without modifying it.
# 3 It is transitive in nature, which means that
#   if class B inherits from another class A,
#   then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
